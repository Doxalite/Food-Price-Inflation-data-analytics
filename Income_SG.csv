"Data refer to resident employed households. A resident employed household refers to a household where the household reference person is a resident (i.e. Singapore citizen or permanent resident), and with at least one employed person.  Household employment income refers to the sum of income received by employed members of the household from employment and business, excluding the income of live-in domestic workers.  Household employment income includes employer Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions.  Monthly household employment income includes one-twelfth of annual bonus.  Data on household employment income refers to household employment income before accounting for Government transfers and taxes, unless stated otherwise.  The dollar values are in nominal terms. More data and analyses on household employment income can be found in the paper 'Key Household Income Trends, 2024'.  The paper can be accessed via the following web-link: www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/households/household-income/publications-and-methodology",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median Monthly Household Employment Income Per Household Member (Including Employer CPF Contributions) (Dollar):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Household employment income per household member refers to the household employment income divided by the total number of members in the household.

Average Monthly Household Employment Income Per Household Member (Including Employer CPF Contributions) (Dollar):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Household employment income per household member refers to the household employment income divided by the total number of members in the household.  For example, if there is one employed person in a household of four, his income is divided by four to derive the income per household member.  The deciles are derived based on the ranking of resident employed households by their monthly household employment income per household member (including employer CPF contributions).  It is notable that some resident employed households in the lowest 10% owned a car (14.1%), employed a domestic worker (16.8%), lived in private property (8.5%) or were with household reference persons aged 65 years and over (37.3%) in 2024.  Not all households are consistently in the same decile group from one year to the next.  For example, a household may move from a higher to a lower decile in a particular year due to the temporary unemployment of a household member, before moving up the deciles when the member resumes employment in the subsequent year.  In comparing the performance of any particular decile group over time, it is therefore relevant to note that the comparison may not pertain to the same group of households.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gini Coefficient Based On Household Employment Income Per Household Member (Including Employer CPF Contributions) Before Accounting For Government Transfers And Taxes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Internationally, there are differences in computation methods adopted by different countries, although the basic concept of Gini remains the same.  One major difference is in the equivalence scale adopted.  Equivalence scales take into account economies of scale within the household, and adjust for household size so that households with different sizes and compositions are comparable. There are different scales used by different countries and international organisations. Household employment income per household member refers to the household employment income divided by the total number of members in the household.  For example, if there is one employed person in a household of four, his income is divided by four to derive the income per household member.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Equivalence scales take into account economies of scale within the household, and adjust for household size so that households with different sizes and compositions are comparable.  There are different scales used by different countries and international organisations. Based on the square root scale, individuals are ranked by their household income on a  per equivalised member basis , which is derived by dividing household income by the square root of household size.  This follows the approach adopted by Organisation of Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) in some reports.  In following this approach, individuals such as children and domestic workers would also be ranked.  It is also noted that some OECD countries publish their own Gini using a different equivalence scale, and not the square root scale.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data on income after accounting for government transfers and taxes for 2024 are preliminary. Similar to past practices, as more administrative data on Government transfers or taxes become available, the coverage has been expanded to include more types of transfers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gini Coefficient:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A summary measure of income inequality. It is equal to zero in the case of total income equality and one in the case of total inequality. The more unequal the income distribution, the larger the value of the Gini coefficient. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Household Employment Income:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Refers to the sum of income received by employed members of the household from employment and business excluding the income of live-in domestic workers. Monthly household employment income includes one-twelfth of the annual bonus. Data on household employment income refer to household employment income before accounting for Government transfers and taxes, unless stated otherwise. As the income data pertain to employment income , the coverage of households is based on resident employed households. Data on household income are based on the sample of households surveyed in the June Comprehensive Labour Force Surveys conducted by the Ministry of Manpower every year, except for 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2020 which are based on the Censuses of Population and the mid-decade General Household Survey. The income estimates are based on income as reported by survey respondents and augmented with administrative data. Survey estimates are subject to sampling variability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Household Employment Income Per Household Member:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Refers to the employment household income divided by the total number of members in the household. For example, if there is one person in a household of four, his income is divided by four to derive the income per household member. This takes into account the different sizes of households in each group and enables analysis of changes in household income, adjusted for changes in household size over time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Modified OECD Scale:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The modified OECD scale assigns the first adult in the household a weight of 1 point, and each additional adult a weight of 0.5 points and each child a weight of 0.3 points. The equivalised household income is derived by dividing the total household income by the sum of the points allocated to the household members. For example, a household comprising 2 adults and 2 children would have a sum total of 2.1 points. If the household has employment income of $4,000, then the equivalised household income would be $1,905 (i.e. $4,000 divided by 2.1). The modified OECD scale is used by Eurostat and countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Resident Employed Households:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Refers to households where the household reference person is a Singapore citizen or permanent resident and with at least one employed person. 
A household refers to (i) a group of two or more persons living together in the same house and sharing common food or other essential arrangements for living; or (ii) a person living alone or a person living with others but having his own food or other essential arrangements for living. Although persons may be living in the same house, they may not be members of the same household.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Square Root Scale:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Based on the square root scale, individuals are ranked by their household income on a ‘per equivalised member basis’, which is derived by dividing household income by the square root of household size. For example, based on the square root scale, a household of 4 having employment income of $4,000 would have an equivalised household income of $2,000 (i.e. $4,000 divided by the square root of 4). Individuals such as children and domestic workers would also be ranked. The square root scale is used by Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in its major reports on inequality. It should be noted that some OECD countries publish their own Gini using a different equivalence scale, and not the square root scale.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
