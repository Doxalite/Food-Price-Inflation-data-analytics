<h1>Data analytics on food price inflation</h1>
  
Doing data analytics on food price inflation to answer the following questions:

1. How has Singaporeâ€™s food prices changed over the years? Is this worrying?

2. Can we predict by how many percentage points will food prices rise next year (2026)?








Additional notes:
- For household income, we use median value of household income in SG, but mean of the 40th-60th percentile household income in US due to data limitations.<br>
  These two values can roughly be comparable to each other since household income distribution around 40-60th percentile should be approximately symmetrical. (Income data is typically right skewed, but only more pronounced above the 80th percentile)
